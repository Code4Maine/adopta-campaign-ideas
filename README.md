At <a href="http://uxweek.com/2012" title="Visit conference website" target="_blank">UX Week 2012</a>, Code for America fellows <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/emily-wright/" title="See Emily's bio" target="_blank">Emily Wright</a>, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012-fellows/#Angel Kittiyachavalit" title="See Angel's bio" target="_blank">Angel Kittiyachavalit</a>, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/sheba-najmi/" title="See Sheba's bio" target="_blank">Sheba Najmi</a>, and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/elizabeth-hunt/" title="See Liz's bio" target="_blank">Elizabeth Hunt</a> presented a workshop titled "Designing for Civic Action."

In the workshop we asked user experience professionals to help us improve the Adopt-a-Hydrant application. Specifically we asked the group to think about new ways we could attract people to adopt hydrants and keep them interested and involved over time.

The <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/adopta-campaign-ideas/wiki">Adopta Campaign Ideas wiki</a> contains ideas and photos from that session. Although our focus was on Adopt-a-Hydrant, we think the ideas are applicable to other Adopta programs (i.e., streams, sirens, sidewalks, etc). We hope you find it useful as you start and grow your own Adopta program.
